This project is currently under development. 

This app is designed to help people who are unsure where to go hiking, allowing them to quickly find a trail that suits their preferences and needs.

I am working hard to bring you a fantastic hiking trails app. 

Future updates will include:

1. **Advanced search filters:**  Users will be able to search trails based on factors such as trail type, difficulty level, distance, elevation, scenery type, transportation options, and more. 
2. **Trail opening status indicator:**  Users can see the current opening status of trails (open, partially open, closed).
3. **Trail feature descriptions:**  Each trail will have a detailed description, including information about its scenery, history, challenges, and nearby attractions.
4. **Weather information:**  Users can see real-time weather information for the trail's location, including temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and humidity.


Check back soon for updates!
